# Document image analysis tools.

## bin/grouting:

An annotation tool running as a minimal webserver.

This tool is designed for extremely fast annotation of text segmentation and transcription in historical manuscripts.
The tool is extremely versatile and can annotate any kind of rectangles in images both as classes or captions.

* grouting is a GROUnd-TruthIMG tool meant for rapid annotation of text regions in images.
* No authorization or authentication is implemented. The service assumes a perfectly safe network firewall.
* The service must be given one or more images as a parameter.
* Groundtruth is stored by the server at same path as each provided image with a file-extention of .json
* Once the server is started, point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ ; ideally use Google chrome.
